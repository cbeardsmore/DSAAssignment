DSA ASSIGNMENT NOTES
--------------------


INPUT FILES
-----------
-DC Description File
-Task File


CARTONS
-------
-Consignment Note. +ve int, (1-1024). UNIQUE for given DC center.
-Product Type. ascii string.
-Wholesaler Name. ascii string.
-Warranty Date. ascii string. format: YYYY-MM-DD (Lifetime = 0000-00-00)


DISTRIBUTION CENTRES (DC)
-------------------------
-Stock Rooms. Fixed Capacity. 0 indexed. Never remodelled. Spots are 0 indexed.
-Need to handle at least 2000+, each with 200+ carton spots

3 LAYOUTS:
	DEAD-END
	--------
	-Stack. LIFO removal. Avoid old products that could expire.
	ROLLING
	-------
	-Queue. FIFO removal. shuffles down, not circular. No gaps between cartons.
	-Less space than Dead-end stock rooms.
	YARD
	----
	-Linked List/General array??. Any carton removed at any time.
	-Most flexible, least amount of space though.
	-Cartons can be added/removed arbitrarily, can be gaps between cartons

-Each DC can have different number of stock rooms.
-Each stock room may have a different capacity.
-Cartons can may between stock rooms, given there is space. (Shuffling around allowed)


DC DESCRIPTION FILE
-------------------
-Colon seperated unix line. 2 distinct sections, seperated by %
-Ignore ALL blank lines, and lines beginning with #
-Must detect errors + discrepencies between 1st and 2nd sections. 

2 Sections:
	DC GEOMETRY
	-----------
	-Each row is a stock room, index of stock room is order of rows
	-First element: D/R/Y type.
	-Other elements: empty (::) or consignment notes (0-indexed)
	CARTON DESCRIPTION
	------------------
	-Each row is a carton. no particular order! 
	-Format is: ConsignmentNote:Warranty:Type:Wholesaler


TASKS

-Searching for cartons

	RECEIVING
	---------
	-Figure out stock room and yard type to store new carton in

	-Algorithm, must be at least half + diagram to justify it
	-Print to standard output, index of stock room + index IN stock room (ONE LINE)
	-REWRITE DC descriptor file, filename appended with "-output"

		TASKFILE
		--------
		-Single row, colon sep value.
		- 'A', followed by 4 carton details.	

	SHIPPING
	--------
	-Find best carton to remove for product + number of moves required
	-Balance between movements + inconveience of room structure
	-Algorithm, half a page + diagram to explain 
	-Print to standard output, index of stock room + index IN stock room (ONE LINE)
	-Next line: print carton description
	-If you can't shuffle cartons, output "STUCK"
	-REWRUTE DC descriptor file, filename appended with "-output" (Including Shuffling)

		TASKFILE
		--------
		-Single row, colon sep value.
